# Project Structure Guide

This is a Streamlit in Snowflake application with four main components:

1. **Cortex Analyst** ([pages/1_Cortex_Analyst.py](mdc:pages/1_Cortex_Analyst.py)): Allows users to ask questions in natural language to get SQL queries, data results, and visualizations.

2. **Report Designer** ([pages/2_Report_Designer.py](mdc:pages/2_Report_Designer.py)): Lets users customize SQL and chart code from Cortex Analyst results, then save as reports.

3. **Map Designer** ( [pages/4_Map_Designer.py](mdc:pages/4_Map_Designer.py)): Specialized page for customizing geospatial visualizations with controls for metrics, colors, hexagon size, and height.

4. **Dashboard** ([pages/3_Dashboard.py](mdc:pages/3_Dashboard.py)): Enables users to create dashboards by adding multiple reports.

Shared functionality:
- Chart utilities are centralized in [utils/chart_utils.py](mdc:utils/chart_utils.py)

All Python libraries must be compliant with the Snowflake Anaconda Channel: https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/snowflake/
